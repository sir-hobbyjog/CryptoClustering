# Crypto Clustering Project

## Project Overview  

This project aims to analyze and cluster cryptocurrencies based on their market data and other features to identify patterns and similarities among them. It uses various data science techniques, including data preprocessing, exploration, dimensionality reduction, and clustering to accomplish this task.  

## Features  
- Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the cryptocurrency data for analysis.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explores the data to find patterns and relationships.  
- Dimensionality Reduction: Applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dataset's dimensionality while preserving its essential features.  
- Clustering: Implements clustering algorithms, such as K-Means, to group cryptocurrencies based on their similarities.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python: The primary programming language.  
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.    
- Scikit-learn: For implementing PCA and K-Means clustering and scaling data.  

## Usage
1. Open the Crypto_Clustering.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Run the cells sequentially to perform data preprocessing, EDA, PCA, and clustering.  
3. Adjust parameters and methods as needed to explore different clustering strategies and outcomes.
